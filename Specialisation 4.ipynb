    "### Edge Detection\n",
    "A problem of fundamental importance in image analysis is edge detection. Edges characterize object boundaries and are therefore useful for segmentation, registration, and identification of objects. A typical application where edge detection techniques are involved is automatic character recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges in an image are pixel locations with abrupt changes in gray levels. If we had a continuous image (i.e., assuming continuous values), we would say that the derivative of the image f(x,y) assumes a local maximum in the direction of the edge. Therefore, one edge detection technique is to measure the gradient of f in a particular location. This is accomplished by using a gradient operator.  Such operators, also called filters, provide finite-difference approximations of the orthogonal gradient vector fx and fy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let H denote a p x p filter and x(m,n) denote an arbitrary image location. The gradient operators are represented by a pair of filters, H1 and H2, which measure the gradient of the image x(m,n) in the two orthogonal directions. Common gradient operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/sobel.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/prewitt.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have computed the gradient values, we can combine them to obtain the gradient vector magnitude. Finally, we decide that the pixel (m,n) for which we have calculated the gradient vector magnitude g(m,n) is an edge location if the gradient vector magnitude is sufficiently large (i.e., larger than a certain threshold t).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways to perform edge detection. Such as Laplacian. The Laplacian method searches for zero crossings in the second derivative of the image to find edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid shrinking the output image, and throwing away information from the edge (will be used only to calculate the output for one pixel, with one padding, it'll effect 4 pixels) we have the following possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Valid convolution: No padding, after convolving (nxn) image * (fxf) filter -> n-f+1 x  n-f+1.\n",
    "* Same convolution: Pad so that the output size is the same as the input size. the ouput size is (n+2p-f+1) x (n+2p-f+1), we can find the number of pixels to pad by fixing n = n+2p-f+1. We find p = (f-1)/2, f is generally an odd number.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the main benefits of padding are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows us to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width would shrink as we go to deeper layers. An important special case is the \"same\" convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It helps us keep more of the information at the border of an image. Without padding, very few values at the next layer would be affected by pixels as the edges of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strided convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using strided convolutions, for an input image of size nxn, and a filter of size fxf, we get an output of size :\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/convs.png\" width=\"300\"> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the formal diffinition of convolutions, we first take the filter and flip it in both the vertical and horizental axis, before applying the convolution operation, what we're actually using in deep learning is **cross-correlation**. Originaly, with the flipping operation, the convolution operation becomes an associative operation (A\\*B)\\*C = A\\*(B\\*C)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cross-correlation* Given an input image I and a filter (kernel) K of dimensions k1×k2, the cross-correlation operation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">  <img src=\"figures/cross_correlation.png\" width=\"300\"> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Convolution*\n",
    "Given an input image I and a filter (kernel) K of dimensions k1×k2, the convolution operation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/convolution.png\" width=\"350\"> </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "it is easy to see that convolution is the same as cross-correlation with a flipped kernel i.e: for a kernel K where K(−m,−n)==K(m,n).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why convolutions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parameter sharing: A feature detector (such as vertical edge detector) that's useful in one part of the image is probably useful in another part of the image.\n",
    "* Sparsity of connection: In each layer, each output layer depends only on a small number of inputs.\n",
    "* Capturing translation invariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolutions over volume\n",
    "\n",
    "We convolve an image of size H x C x W by a filters (F x F x W) x N_filters and we get as an output: (H-f+1) x (W-f+1) x N_filter (in case no padding and no stride)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/conv_volume.jpg\" width=\"500\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct one layer of convolutionnal network, given a number of 3D filters, after convolving the input and obtaining a 3D volution where the depth = number of filter, we add biases to each one and apply a non linearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/notations.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pooling layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling (POOL) layer reduces the height and width of the input. It helps reduce computation, as well as helps make feature detectors more invariant to their position in the input. The two types of pooling layers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Max-pooling layer: slides an (f, f) window over the input and stores the max value of the window in the output.\n",
    "- Average-pooling layer: slides an (f, f) window over the input and stores the average value of the window in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pool layers are in charge of downsampling the spatial dimensions of the input. The most common setting is to use max-pooling with 2x2 receptive fields (i.e. F=2), and with a stride of 2 (i.e. S=2). Thus discarding exactly 75% of the activations in an input volume (due to downsampling by 2 in both width and height). Another slightly less common setting is to use 3x3 receptive fields with a stride of 2, but it is very uncommon to see receptive field sizes for max pooling that are larger than 3 because the pooling is then too lossy and aggressive. This usually leads to worse performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Global average pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "GAP is used as replacement to the traditional fully connected layers in CNN. The idea is to generate one feature map for each corresponding category of the classification task in the last mlpconv layer. Instead of adding fully connected layers on top of the feature maps, we take the average of each feature map, and the resulting vector is fed directly into the softmax layer.  One advantage of global average pooling over the fully connected layers is that it is more native to the convolution structure by enforcing correspondences between feature maps and categories. Thus the feature maps can be easily interpreted as the confidence maps of the categories.  Another advantage is that there is no parameter to optimize in the global average pooling thus overfitting is avoided at this layer.  Futhermore, global average pooling sums out the spatial information, thus it is more robust to spatial translations of the input. We can see global average pooling as a structural regularizer that explicitly enforces feature maps to be confidence maps of concepts (categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of GAP, With a 3D 8,8,10 tensor, we compute the average over the 8,8 slices, we end up with a 3D tensor of shape 1,1,10 that we reshape into a 1D vector of shape 10. And then we add a softmax operator without any operation in between. The tensor before the average pooling is supposed to have as many channels as as the number of classes we're trying to detect (we can always use conv 1x1 to adjust the depth of the feature maps).\n",

    "#### Convolutional layer backward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing dA:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the formula for computing $dA$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$\" title=\"$W_c$ and a given training example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dA += \\sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \\sum_{w=0} ^{n_W} W_c \\times dZ_{hw}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $W_c$ is a filter and $dZ_{hw}$ is a scalar corresponding to the gradient of the cost with respect to the output of the conv layer Z at the hth row and wth column (corresponding to the dot product taken at the ith stride left and jth stride down). At each time, we multiply the the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different slice of the activation (when we do a sliding window). Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, we are just adding the gradients of all the activation slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/gradient_CNN.png\" width=\"600\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing dW:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the formula for computing $dW_c$ is the derivative of one filter) with respect to the loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ dW_c += \\sum _{h=0} ^{n_H} \\sum_{w=0} ^ {n_W} a_{slice} \\times dZ_{hw} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $a_{slice}$ corresponds to the slice which was used to generate the acitivation $Z_{ij}$. Hence, this ends up giving us the gradient for $W$ with respect to that slice. Since it is the same $W$, we will just add up all such gradients to get $dW$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computing db:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the formula for computing $db$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ db = \\sum_h \\sum_w dZ_{hw}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "db is computed by summing $dZ$. In this case, you are just summing over all the gradients of the conv output (Z) with respect to the cost.\n",
    "\n",

    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/lenet5_archi.png\" width=\"750\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "A modern version will use softmax with 10 outputs instead of Gaussian connections, the network has 60k parameters, generally the spatial dimension nh and nw are reduced while nc is increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper they use sigmoid/tanh, and the non lienarity is applied after pooling, and the filters are not applied to all the channels, but only a specific channels to reduce computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AlexNet\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/alexnet.png\" width=\"750\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The nework is quite similar to LeNet5, but this time it is much bigger, with 60M parameters, and the non linearity used is ReLU, and some tricks to train the network on two GPUs: *The parallelization scheme that we employ essentially puts half of the kernels (or neurons) on each GPU, with one additional trick:  the GPUs communicate only in certain layers.  This means that, for example, the kernels of layer 3 take input from all kernel maps in layer 2. However, kernels in layer 4 take input only from those kernel maps in layer 3 which reside on the same GPU. Choosing the pattern of connectivity is a problem for cross-validation, but this allows us to precisely tune the amount of communication until it is an acceptable fraction of the amount of computation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "They also use Local Response Normalization (LRN): *ReLUs have the desirable property that they do not require input normalization to prevent them from saturating. If at least some training examples produce a positive input to a ReLU, learning will happen in that neuron.  However, we still find that the following local normalization scheme aids generalization.* So each neurone in a spatial dimension (x,y) is normalized by the sum of n adjacent kernel maps at the same spatial position, where n is the number of kernels in that layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### VGG-16\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/vgg16.png\"  width=\"750\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "16 refers to the number of layers containing trainable parameters, 13 CONVs, 2 FC and one softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this architecture, we focus on using only 3x3 filters and doubling number of filters: nw/nh goes down by 2 and nc goes up by two, stride of one, and SAME padding with maxpooling is applied. The total number of parameters are 138M parameters, but the simplicity of the network makes it quite easy to implement and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ResNets\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction, from edges (at the lower layers) to very complex features (at the deeper layers). However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent unbearably slow. More specifically, during gradient descent, as we backprop from the final layer back to the first layer, we are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and \"explode\" to take very large values).\n",

    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/skipconnection.png\" width=\"650\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the use of skip connection, we assure that in the worst case the network will learn the identiy function (al>0 after Relu, so after the skip connection we have g(z(l+2)*w + al), if w = 0 then g(al)= al) and the performances will not be reduced after adding more layers, sometimes, the skip connection might use conv layers in between to adjust the dimension of the previous activation before forwarding them to the upcoming layer.\n",

    "#### Identity block\n",
    "\n",
    "The identity block is the standard block used in ResNets, and corresponds to the case where the input activation (say a[l]) has the same dimension as the output activation (say a[l+2]). To flesh out the different steps of what happens in a ResNet's identity block, here is an alternative diagram showing the individual steps:\n",

    "### Practical advies\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Transfer learning:* It is always better to use pretrained networks for our task, either by eliminating the softmax layer and replacing it with a new one, and all the previous layers become fixed, and we can even compute the last activation for all the training examples and save them to disk to reduce the computations, or fine tune the last layers or even the whole network if we have enough data.\n",
    "* *Data augmentation:* Given that we often do not have enough data, data augmentation techniques help a lot: Mirroring, Random Cropping, Rotation, Shearing, Local warping, Color shifting (PCA color augmentation). This is implemented using some CPU threads to do data augmentation and data preparation and feed it to other GPU threads for training the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PCA color augmentation:** For every image each pixel is a data point which is having 3 vectors: R,G,B. We can compute co-variance matrix of these vectors in order to compute the PCA. If we take 3x3 matrix size, computing PCA results in 3 vectors with 3 components. We can then sample 3 scale parameters, and add scaled versions of each of these 3 vectors to all pixels in the image. For best results we should also scale them by the corresponding eigenvalues. This will perturb the image colors along these PCA axes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The loss in this case can be log likelihood for the class predictions, and L2 loss for bounding box, and for Pc we can use logistic regression loss.\n",

    "One possibility is to use a sliding windows (with varying sizes and ratios) over the image, each time, we crop the specific window of the image and forward the crop into a CNN and predict the coresponding class, but the downside of such method is the great computationnal cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "The problem with the previous approach, is that there is a large number of possible bounding boxes in the image where the object might be present, and the window does not match exactly the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO proposes a solution to this problem, by dividing the input image into a grid; say 3x3 grid or even 19x19 grid for finer detection, and for each grid we do a simple object localization, where the network output the class probabilities and box coordinates of the main object in the cell, for each grid cell, the network is assigned the task of detecting the object for which its center belong to that grid cell, even is the object spans different grid cells (the cars in the example bellow).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">  <img src=\"figures/yolo.png\" width=\"650\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "For each grid cell, the network ouputs a vector of size (5 + #Classes), the probability of the presence of a given object (Pc), and bounding box coordinates and the probabilities for each class. So the ouput of the CNN will be a volume of size GxGX(5 + #Classes), where GxG is the number of grids chosen, in this example, the output is 3x3x8.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the object is assigned to the grid cell containing the center of its bounding box, bx and by are always < 1 (sigmoid is used), and bw and bh can be greater than one given that some object might span different cells. And bx, by, bw and bh are always relative to the given cell coordiantes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intersection Over Union\n",
    "\n",
    "Intersection of two boxes / their union, is a way to measure how close are predicted bounding boxes (bb) to the ground truth one, IoU is used to measure the overlap between two bb, if IoU > Some threshold, like 0.5, the bb is considered correct.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Non-max Suppression**: Given that even if only one object is assigned to one grid cell, with a dense grid (say 19x19), neighboring grids may also localize the object in question, non max suppression is a mechanism to supress the similar predicted bb that are referencing the same object and keeping only the most confident bb.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done as follows (# Classes = 1 in this example)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"figures/non_max_supp.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anchor Boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the previous appraoch, each object in training image is assigned to grid cell that contains that object's midpoint, so one grid cell can only detect one object even if we assign multiple objects to the same grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we define anchor boxes, with predefined size and ratios to every single grid cell, and now the CNN will output (5 + #Classes) x #Anchors for each grid cell.\n",

    "\n",
    "When constructing the training labels, we assign a given object to a given cell and to a given anchor in the cell depending on the IoU, if for a given cell does not contain any object, which is the case in many grid cells, we assign Pc to 0 and the rest to *dont cares*. And we can expect a similar thing when doing predicitions.\n",

    "#### Region Proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of defining anchor boxes over all the images and predicting the object, with R-CNN, we first apply selective search, which is a segmentation algorithm, and then define possible boxes based on the segmentation blobs, and then run CNN for each box to detect if an object is present or not.\n",

    "\n",
    "YOLO (\"you only look once\") is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time.

    "With face recognition using CNN with an input as the person's image, and outputs is a softmax a label over K persons, one of the difficulties in such approach is being able to train the model using only one traning example for each person (K person in the database), this is called **One shot learning**. We also need to retain our model each time we add a new person to the database, and in test time we need to compare the input to all the databases instances.\n",

    "\n",
    "We're going to define a cost function, and by minising this cost function by gradient descent we can generate the image G.

    "\n",
    "We use a pre-trained CNN net like VGG, and after choosing a given layer, we compare the activation of the content image and the generated image. Let $a^{(C)}$ be the hidden layer activations in the layer we have chosen. This will be a $n_H \\times n_W \\times n_C$ tensor. We repeat this process with the image G: Set G as the input, and run forward progation. Let $a^{(G)}$ be the corresponding hidden layer activation. We will define as the content cost function as:\n",

In order to compute the cost $J_{content}(C,G)$, it might also be convenient to unroll these 3D volumes into a 2D matrix, as shown below. (Technically this unrolling step isn't needed to compute $J_{content}$, but it will be good practice for when we need to carry out a similar operation later for computing the style const $J_{style}$.)\n",

In other words, $G_{ij}$ compares how similar $v_i$ is to $v_j$: If they are highly similar, you would expect them to have a large dot product, and thus for $G_{ij}$ to be large.\n",

For example, suppose filter i is detecting vertical textures in the image. Then $G_{ii}$ measures how common  vertical textures are in the image as a whole: If $G_{ii}$ is large, this means that the image has a lot of vertical texture.\n",
