    "* b: 1 x outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression: Given X, we want $y_{predicted} = P(y=1 | x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "To have the output in the range of [0,1], to be interpreted as probability, we use a non linear activation function : sigmoid, to squash the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{predicted} = sigmoid(W^T X + b)\\ = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(W^T x + b)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "W : [Inputs x Outputs] and X : [Inputs x Batch]\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Function : Given Inputs and their Targets, our goal is to have the predictions to be equal to the Targets.\n",
    "We define a loss function to be a convex function to be able to find its minimum using gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we use Max Likelihood for classification ?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we perform binary classification (with classes 1 and -1),  we use the input X to arrive at a prediction  $y_{predicted}$\"  where for $y_{predicted}$\" />>=0, depending on the value of the output we classify that observation as class 1 or class -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we judge the performance? ideally, we want to maximize the accuracy, by giving a zero loss if sign of $y_{predicted}$\"  agree with the sign of the true class, i.e. $y. y_{predicted}$\" >=0 . Otherwise, if we make the wrong prediction, the loss is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that:\n",
    "- If y = 1, $P(y|x) = y_{predicted}$.\n",
    "- If y = 0, $P(y|x) = 1 - y_{predicted}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss function, that is the closer to such objective, while being a convex function is :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(y, y_{predicted}) = - ( y\\ log(y_{predicted}) + (1 - y)\\ log(1 - y_{predicted}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If y = 0, so we want $y_{predicted}$\" to be small, and this is done by minimising the loss \"$l = - log(1 - y_{predicted})$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost function measure the performances over all the training set, just the average loss over all example.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\mathcal{L}(y^i, y_{predicted}^i)$$\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can write the probability as : $P(y|x) = y_{predicted}^y \\times (1- y_{predicted})^{(1 - y)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to maximise P(y|x), given that for multiple example (iid), we'd like to maximise the product of their probabilities, so it is easier to use the log, which is a monotonic function, and maximise their summation, or minimise - loss.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\frac{dl}{dw} = \\frac{dl}{dy_{predicted}} \\frac{dy_{predicted}}{dz} \\frac{dz}{dw}$$\\\\ $$z = W^T X + b,\\ \\text{Thus}\\ \\frac{dz}{dw} = X$$\\\\ $$y_{predicted} = sigmoid(z),\\ \\text{Thus}\\ \\frac{dy_{predicted}}{dz} = y_{predicted}(1 - y_{predicted})$$\\\\ $$\\frac{dl}{dy_{predicted}} = \\frac{(y_{predicted} - y)}{y_{predicted}(1 - y_{predicted})}$$\\\\ $$\\text{So} : \\frac{dl}{dw} = X (y_{predicted} - y)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$z^{(i)} = w^T x^{(i)} + b$$\\\\ \\\\ $$y_{predicted}^{(i)} = a^{(i)} = sigmoid(z^{(i)})$$\\\\ \\\\ $$ \\mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) = - y^{(i)} \\log(a^{(i)}) - (1-y^{(i)} ) \\log(1-a^{(i)})$$\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Propagation:\n",
    "- Get an training set X (m examples)\n",
    "- Compute $A = \\sigma(w^T X + b) = (a^{(1)}, a^{(2)}, ..., a^{(m-1)}, a^{(m)})$\n",
    "- Calculate the cost function: $$J = -\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{(i)}\\log(a^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})\\log(1-a^{(i)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Backward Propagation:\n",
    "- Compute garadients with the cost respect to the weights $$\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w} = \\frac{1}{m}X(A-Y)^T$$,\n",

    "- For a parameter $\\theta$ (weights & bias), we update by $\\theta = \\theta - \\alpha \\text{ } d\\theta$, \\text{where } $\\alpha$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for Gradient Descent to work we must choose the learning rate wisely. The learning rate Î± determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may \"overshoot\" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Broadcasting & Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "For a matrix of size (m, n), if we apply an operation using an (1, n) matrix, the latter will be broadcasted into (m, n), i.e., the row will be copied m times, same for an (m, 1) matrix, the column will be braodcasted n times into (m, n).\n",
    "\n",
    "In we create a vector of random gussian values : `a = np.random.rand(5)`, this in case, a is rank one matrix with a shape of `(5, )`, if we do `a.T` we'll get the same output, and `a @ a.T` gives us a scalar instead of 5 x 5 matrix, it is easier to specify the dimensions of the desired matrix, such as `a = np.random.rand(5, 1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation function\n",
    "The tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero, and so it centers the data better for the next layer. But for binary classifiers, it is better to use singmoid functions as the outputs layer in case the output is in the range of [0,1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero initiallisation\n",
    "Each neuron in the first hidden layer will perform the same computation. So even after multiple iterations of gradient descent each neuron in the layer will be computing the same thing as other neurons. Logistic regression's weights `w` should be initialized randomly rather than to all zeros, because if we initialize to all zeros, then logistic regression will fail to learn a useful decision boundary because it will fail to \"break symmetry\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shallow neural nets <a name=\"shallow_nets\"></a>\n",
    "Logistic regression is very limited, we go directly from the inputs to the prediction, one possible way to improve the performance is to add a hidden layer to learn higher level abstraction of the inputs:\n",

    "#### Backpropagation\n",

    "\n",
    "The backpropagation is very similar to the forward propagation, the difference is that this time instead of calculating the activations for the first layer to the last, we'll backpropagate the error from the last layer to the first, each time step, by calculating the derivatives of the cost with respect to the activations $$\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{a^l}}$$. and reuse $$\\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{a^l}}$$ of the last layer to calculate the derivatives of the cost with respect to the weights and biases.\n",

    "The next step is to back propagate the derivatives of the cost with respect to the activation of layer L to layer L-1 and get the derivatives with respect to the activations of layer L-1, and then we get derivatives with respect to the parameters the same way, by multiplying the local derivatives to the inputs of the previous layer L-2:\n",
