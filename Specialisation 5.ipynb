    "Say we want a network to determine the names present is the input phrases (persons names, companies names... ) So, this is a problem called Named-entity recognition and this is used by search engines for example, the inputs are the words (each one is indexed in the input sequence) with a binary ouput to tell if the word is a name or not.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Recurent neural nets\n",
    "We could use a standard network, taking as input $T_x$\" words and outputing $T_y$ outputs, the problems with such approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inputs and ouputs can be different lengths in different examples.\n",
    "- Doesn't share features learned across different position of text (the same word reappering in a different position mean the word is also a person's name).\n",
    "- The length of the inputs are quite big, depending on the size of the dictionnary, so the network will have an enormous number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/net_words.png\" width=\"400\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "To take into account the nature of sequence data, RNNs use recurrent connections to take as inputs, in addition to the current word in the input sequence, the state at the previous time step. With two weight matrices, Wax (input -> hidden state) and Waa (previous hidden state -> current one) and Wya (hidden state -> output), we generally start the previous hidden state with Zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/RNNs.png\" width=\"400\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "A Recurrent neural network can also be seen as the repetition of a single cell. The following figure describes the operations for a single time-step of an RNN cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/rnn_cell.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Side note:* Sometimes, the network might also need to take into account not only the previous words but also the comming words in the sequence for better predictions, per example; \"He said, Teddy Roosevelt was a great president\", to be able to predict Teddy as a name, having both the previous words and Roosevelt will given the network a better change to classify it as a name. This implemented in Bidirectionnal RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a ^ { < t > } = g \\left( W _ { a a } a ^ { < t - 1 > } + W _ { a x } x ^ { < t > } + b _ { a } \\right)$$\n",

    "$$\\hat { y } ^ { < t > } = g \\left( W _ { y a } a ^ { < t > } + b _ { y } \\right)$$\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Back propagation through time\n",
    "\n",
    "In general :\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, present the input pattern and propagate it through the network to get the output.\n",
    "- Then compare the predicted output to the expected output and calculate the error.\n",
    "- Then calculate the derivates of the error with respect to the network weights\n",
    "- Try to adjust the weights so that the error is minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Backpropagation algorithm is suitable for the feed forward neural network on fixed sized input-output pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Backpropagation Through Time is the application of Backpropagation training algorithm which is applied to the sequence data like the time series. It is applied to the recurrent neural network. The recurrent neural network is shown one input each timestep and predicts the corresponding output. So, we can say that BTPP works by unrolling all input timesteps. Each timestep has one input time step, one output time step and one copy of the network. Then the errors are calculated and accumulated for each timestep. The network is then rolled back to update the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example above, where we have binary classification, we can define a loss at each time step by a simple logistic regression loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal { L } ^ { < t > }( \\hat { y } ^ { < t > } , y ^ { < t > }) = - y^{<t>} \\log(\\hat{y}^{<t>}) - (1 - y^{<t>}) \\log(1 - \\hat{y}^{<t>})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the calculate the loss for the whole sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathcal { L }(\\hat{y} , y) = \\sum_1^{T_y} \\mathcal { L } ^ { < t > } \\left( \\hat { y } ^ { < t > } , y ^ { < t > } \\right)$$\n",

    "* Many to many: both the input and output are sequences and Tx = Ty.\n",
    "* Many to many: both the input and output are sequences but this time with different lengths, like Machine translation, with two distinct part, an encoder and a decoder.\n",
    "* Many to one: In sentiment analysis per example, where we input a sequence and ouput a sentiment / integer between 0..5 on how positive or negative the input text is.\n",
    "* one to one: ordinary nets, like feed forward nets.\n",
    "* One to many: Like music generation, where we input one note and the network starts generating music notes, and reuse the outputs as net inputs to generate further new music.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Language Modeling and LM for short, is the development of probabilistic models that are able to predict the next word in the sequence given the words that precede it. A statistical language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. Given such a sequence, say of length m, it assigns a probability $P(w_{1},\\ldots ,w_{m})$ to the whole sequence. Having a way to estimate the relative likelihood of different phrases is useful in many natural language processing applications, especially ones that generate text as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Language modeling is the task of assigning a probability to sentences in a language. […] Besides assigning a probability to each sequence of words, the language models also assigns a probability for the likelihood of a given word (or a sequence of words) to follow a sequence of words - Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "A language model learns the probability of word occurrence based on examples of text. Simpler models may look at a context of a short sequence of words, whereas larger models may work at the level of sentences or paragraphs. Most commonly, language models operate at the level of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The notion of a language model is inherently probabilistic. A language model is a function that puts a probability measure over strings drawn from some vocabulary - An Introduction to Information Retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNN model** The RNN model for a language models, takes at the first time step a zero vector, and outputs with a softmax layer the probability over all possible words for the incoming words, the next input is the correct first word that the model should have predicted, and the goal now is to predict the second one given the first word p(X | word1), and so on, until the last word where the model needs to predict end of sentence token \\<EOS\\>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/train_lan_model.png\" width=\"700\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "To train this network we define a softmax loss function associated with each word / time step, and some over these losses to get the global cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal { L } \\left( \\hat { y } ^ { < t > } , y ^ { < t > } \\right) = - \\sum _ { i } y _ { i } ^ { < t > } \\log \\hat { y } _ { i } ^ { < t > }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal { L } = \\sum _ { L } \\mathcal { L } \\left( \\hat { y } ^ { < t > } , y ^ { < t > } \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling novel sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "After we train a sequence model, one of the ways we can informally get a sense of what is learned is sampling novel sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence model models the probability of any sequences of words as P(y\\<1\\> .... y\\<Tx\\>), and we want to sample from this distribution to generate novel sentences, for this we start with zero vectors, and we sample randomly from the output probability distribution of possible words (p(a), p(and) .... depending on the size of the dictionnary) and use the chosen word as the input for the next time step and keep doing the same thing, until we sample \\<EOS\\>, and we can reject any \\<unk\\> token we sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/lan_model.png\" width=\"500\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we can have also character level language models, where the dictionnary is all possible characters (lower and upper case) and possible symbols (, ;). some pros are not even worying about \\<unk\\> tokens, but we might end up with many sequences and are more computationnaly expensive to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vanashing and exploding gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problem with vanilla RNNs is the vanashing and exploding gradients. In language we can have very long dependencies, like in the sentence \"the *cat/cats* with .. ate ...... *was / were* \", depending on cat being plural or singular, the network needs to ouputs the correct prediction later in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn such dependecies, the gradient from (was / were) needs to backpropagate over large number of steps to affect the earlier layers and modify how the RNN do computation in these layers, and with the problem of vanashing and exploding gradients, this becomes very unlikely, so in RNNs we only have local dependencies, where each word only depend on a limited number of words proceding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient clipping: For exploding gradient we can apply gradient clipping, The overall loop structure usually consists of a forward pass, a cost computation, a backward pass, and a parameter update. Before updating the parameters, we perform gradient clipping when needed to make sure that the gradients are not \"exploding,\" meaning taking on overly large values, but for vanashing gradients is much harder to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/gradient_clipping.png\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can vizualise the GRU unit as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/GRU_unit.png\" width=\"350\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "GRU will have a new cell C called memory cell, providing a bit of memory to remeber if the car was singular or plural,$c^{<t>}$ will output an activation $a^{<t>}$, at every time step, we'll consider writing $\\tilde{C}^{<t>}$ to the memory cell, and the important idea of GRU, is having a gate $\\Gamma_u$ between zero and one (zero or one most of the time), and the gate will decide if we update the memory cell with the condidate $\\tilde{C}^{<t>}$ or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have another gate  $\\Gamma_r$ which tells us how relative is the sate of the memory cell to compute the new condidate for the memory cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/GRU_equations.png\" width=\"300\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell memory cell and the gate have the same dimension as the state of the hidden layer (element wise multiplication in the updating step).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, after the network output was/were depending on the state of cat, we can then update the state of the memory cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LSTMs\n",
    "\n",
    "GRUs can allow us to learn very long range connections in a sequence. The other type of unit that allow us to do this very well is the LSTM or the long short term memory units. In LSTMs, instead of having one gate to decide wheather we update the state of the memory cell or not, we'll have two seperate gates, forget and update gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/LSTMs.png\" width=\"700\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forget gate\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this illustration, lets assume we are reading words in a piece of text, and want use an LSTM to keep track of grammatical structures, such as whether the subject is singular or plural. If the subject changes from a singular word to a plural word, we need to find a way to get rid of our previously stored memory value of the singular/plural state. In an LSTM, the forget gate lets us do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_f[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $W_f$ are weights that govern the forget gate's behavior. We concatenate $[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}]$ and multiply by $W_f$. The equation above results in a vector $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ with values between 0 and 1. This forget gate vector will be multiplied element-wise by the previous cell state $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. So if one of the values of $\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is 0 (or close to 0) then it means that the LSTM should remove that piece of information (e.g. the singular subject) in the corresponding component of $c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$. If one of the values is 1, then it will keep the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update gate\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we forget that the subject being discussed is singular, we need to find a way to update it to reflect that the new subject is now plural. Here is the formulat for the update gate: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\sigma(W_u[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\{t\\}}] + b_u)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the forget gate, here $\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ is again a vector of values between 0 and 1. This will be multiplied element-wise with $\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, in order to compute $c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "To update the new subject we need to create a new vector of numbers that we can add to our previous cell state. The equation we use is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\tanh(W_c[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the new cell state is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}* c^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle} + \\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle} *\\tilde{c}^{\\langle t \\rangle}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output gate\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which outputs we will use, we will use the following two formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}= \\sigma(W_o[a^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}, x^{\\langle t \\rangle}] + b_o)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a^{\\langle t \\rangle} = \\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}* \\tanh(c^{\\langle t \\rangle})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we decide what to output using a sigmoid function, and then we multiply that by the $\\tanh$ of the previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LSTM backward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "**One Step backward**\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM backward pass is slighltly more complicated than the forward one:\n",

    "\n",
    "To calculate $db_f, db_u, db_c, db_o$ we just need to sum across the horizontal (axis= 1) axis on $d\\Gamma_f^{\\langle t \\rangle}, d\\Gamma_u^{\\langle t \\rangle}, d\\tilde c^{\\langle t \\rangle}, d\\Gamma_o^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ respectively. This is done beacuse in the forward pass an automatic broadcasting was perfomed.\n",

    "Finally, we will compute the derivative with respect to the previous hidden state, previous memory state, and input.\n",

    "### Bidirectionnal RNNs\n",

    "\n",
    "BRNN tries to solve this issue using two compoents, forward component and backward component, thus defining an acyclic graph, where in the first step, we go from left to right to compute the forward activations, and then go back and compute the backward activations for the second component, all of this in the forward pass.\n",

    "\n",
    "Word embeddings is a way of representing words, to give the model a possibility to automatically understand analogies like, a man is to a woman, as a king is to a queen, and many other examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Representation: So far we're representing words using a vocabulary of words, and each input is a one hot vector of the size of the vocabulary. The problem is that there isn't any relationship between the words, given that the product between any two vector is zero and not the similarity of the two words.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are able to learn a given vector representation (dimension of the vector << size of the vocabulary), and take this high dimentionnal data and embed it on 2D space, we see similar words closer together. These word embeddings are trained in an unsupervised manner using very large corpus (100 Billion words) and then we can reuse them for specific tasks using the learned embeddings (a form of transfer learning), with the possbility to continue to adjust / fine tune the word embeddings for our tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we take the same example in first week, using an RNN to detect the names in a given sentence, using word embeddings as inputs to the model instead of one hot vector, the model will be able to generalize more easily, and given new word (like durian, which is a fruit), even if the model see them for the first time, their word representations are similar to already seen examples.\n",

    "3. Optionnal: continue to finetune the words embeddings with new data.\n",

We can sample the context words using a uniform distribution; but we'll end up sampling the common words much more often, in practice different huristics can be used to balance the sampling.\n",

In linear algebra, we say that the 49 dimensional $g_{\\perp}$ is perpendicular (or \"othogonal\") to g, meaning it is at 90 degrees to g. The neutralization step takes a vector such as $e_{receptionist}$ and zeros out the component in the direction of g, giving us $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$.\n",

But this still does not guarantee that \"actor\" and \"actress\" are equidistant from \"babysit.\" The equalization algorithm takes care of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equi-distant from the 49-dimensional $g_{\\perp}$.

As discussed earlier, if g were defined by computing $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$ \\ ; \\ $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, we would obtain a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space.\n",

    "**Illustration of Attention mechanism**: This is an example of using the attention mecanism to do from dates in the numerical format to characters, here is a more detailed illustration of the attenstion mecanism. The diagram on the left shows the attention model. The diagram on the right shows what one \"Attention\" step does to calculate the attention variables $\\alpha^{\\langle t, t' \\rangle}$, which are used to compute the context variable $context^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ for each timestep in the output ($t=1, \\ldots, T_y$).\n",

    "Here are some properties of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two separate LSTMs in this model (see diagram on the left). Because the one at the bottom of the picture is a Bi-directional LSTM and comes *before* the attention mechanism, we will call it *pre-attention* Bi-LSTM. The LSTM at the top of the diagram comes *after* the attention mechanism, so we will call it the *post-attention* LSTM. The pre-attention Bi-LSTM goes through $T_x$ time steps; the post-attention LSTM goes through $T_y$ time steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The post-attention LSTM passes $s^{\\langle t \\rangle}, c^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ from one time step to the next. In the lecture videos, we were using only a basic RNN for the post-activation sequence model, so the state captured by the RNN output activations $s^{\\langle t\\rangle}$. But since we are using an LSTM here, the LSTM has both the output activation $s^{\\langle t\\rangle}$ and the hidden cell state $c^{\\langle t\\rangle}$. However, unlike previous text generation examples, in this model the post-activation LSTM at time t does will not take the specific generated $y^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$ as input; it only takes $s^{\\langle t\\rangle}$ and $c^{\\langle t\\rangle}$ as input. We have designed the model this way, because (unlike language generation where adjacent characters are highly correlated) there isn't as strong a dependency between the previous character and the next character in a YYYY-MM-DD date. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We use $a^{\\langle t \\rangle} = [\\overrightarrow{a}^{\\langle t \\rangle}; \\overleftarrow{a}^{\\langle t \\rangle}]$ to represent the concatenation of the activations of both the forward-direction and backward-directions of the pre-attention Bi-LSTM. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The diagram on the right uses a `RepeatVector` node to copy $s^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$'s value $T_x$ times, and then `Concatenation` to concatenate $s^{\\langle t-1 \\rangle}$ and $a^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ to compute $e^{\\langle t, t'\\rangle}$, which is then passed through a softmax to compute $\\alpha^{\\langle t, t' \\rangle}$.\n",

    "### Speech recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "the goal of speech recongnition, is to use an input x as 1D sound wave /  preprocess to obtain spectogramms, and obtain as ouput the transcript, we can use in such problem a RNN, taking as inputs the sound wave at each time step, depending on the frequence, one ouputing either the character, or a blank space. In this case the number of inputs steps is greater the the ouputs, for that we ue CTC, connectionnist temporal classification to reduce the output to the correct transcript (tttt ____ hh __ ee -> the) without having to give the correct labels at each time step, just the correct word (the).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application: Trigger words\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From audio recordings to spectrograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the details of a system capable of detecting a triger word, in this example the trigger word is `activate` given positives, recordings of activate, and negatives, which are recodings of other words, and background sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "What really is an audio recording? A microphone records little variations in air pressure over time, and it is these little variations in air pressure that the ear also perceives as sound. We can think of an audio recording as a long list of numbers measuring the little air pressure changes detected by the microphone. We will use audio sampled at 44100 Hz. This means the microphone gives us 44100 measurements per second. Thus, a 10 second audio clip is represented by 441000 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is quite difficult to figure out from this \"raw\" representation of audio whether the word \"activate\" was said. In  order to help the sequence model more easily learn to detect triggerwords, we will compute a *spectrogram* of the audio. The spectrogram tells us how much different frequencies are present in an audio clip at a moment in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A spectrogram is computed by sliding a window over the raw audio signal, and calculates the most active frequencies in each window using a Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectogram represents how active each frequency is (y axis) over a number of time-steps (x axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/spectogram.png\" width=\"400\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectrogram of an audio recording, where the color shows the degree to which different frequencies are present (loud) in the audio at different points in time. Green squares means a certain frequency is more active or more present in the audio clip (louder); blue squares denote less active frequencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dimension of the output spectrogram depends upon the hyperparameters of the spectrogram software and the length of the input. Given 10 second audio clips as the \"standard length\" for the training examples. The number of timesteps of the spectrogram will be 5511, so $T_x = 5511$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With 10 seconds being the default training example length, 10 seconds of time can be discretized to different numbers of value. With 441000 hz (raw audio) and 5511 (spectrogram). In the former case, each step represents $10/441000 \\approx 0.000023$ seconds. In the second case, each step represents $10/5511 \\approx 0.0018$ seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the 10sec of audio:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 441000 (raw audio)\n",
    "- 10000 used to synthesize audio\n",
    "- $5511 = T_x$ (spectrogram output, and dimension of input to the neural network). \n",
    "- $1375 = T_y$ (the number of steps in the output of the GRU). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these representations correspond to exactly 10 seconds of time. It's just that they are discretizing them to different degrees. All of these are hyperparameters and can be changed (except the 441000, which is a function of the microphone). We have chosen values that are within the standard ranges uses for speech systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the $T_y = 1375$ number above. This means that for the output of the model, we discretize the 10s into 1375 time-intervals (each one of length $10/1375 \\approx 0.0072$ s) and try to predict for each of these intervals whether someone recently finished saying \"activate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider also the 10000 number above. This corresponds to discretizing the 10sec clip into 10/10000 = 0.001 second itervals. it means we are using 10,000 steps. To be used to generate training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a single training example\n",
    "\n",
    "Because speech data is hard to acquire and label, it is better to synthesize the training data using the audio clips of activates, negatives, and backgrounds. It is quite slow to record lots of 10 second audio clips with random \"activates\" in it. Instead, it is easier to record lots of positives and negative words, and record background noise separately (or download background noise from free online sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "To synthesize a single training example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick a random 10 second background audio clip\n",
    "- Randomly insert 0-4 audio clips of \"activate\" into this 10sec clip\n",
    "- Randomly insert 0-2 audio clips of negative words into this 10sec clip\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we synthesized the word \"activate\" into the background clip, we know exactly when in the 10sec clip the \"activate\" makes its appearance. Given that $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ represent whether or not someone has just finished saying \"activate.\" Given a background clip, we can initialize $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}=0$ for all t, since the clip doesn't contain any \"activates.\", When we insert or overlay an \"activate\" clip, we will also update labels for $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, so that 50 steps (50 steps because we would be quite satisfied if the GRU detects \"activate\" anywhere within a short time-internal after finishing saying activate moment) of the output now have target label 1. And we will train a GRU to detect when someone has *finished* saying \"activate\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"figures/model_triger_words.png\" width=\"550\"></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "One key step of this model is the 1D convolutional step. It inputs the 5511 step spectrogram, and outputs a 1375 step output, which is then further processed by multiple layers to get the final $T_y = 1375$ step output. This layer plays a role similar to the 2D convolutions you saw in CNNs, of extracting low-level features and then possibly generating an output of a smaller dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computationally, the 1-D conv layer also helps speed up the model because now the GRU  has to process only 1375 timesteps rather than 5511 timesteps. The two GRU layers read the sequence of inputs from left to right, then ultimately uses a dense+sigmoid layer to make a prediction for $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$. Because y is binary valued (0 or 1), we use a sigmoid output at the last layer to estimate the chance of the output being 1, corresponding to the user having just said \"activate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use a uni-directional RNN rather than a bi-directional RNN. This is really important for trigger word detection, since we want to be able to detect the trigger word almost immediately after it is said. If we used a bi-directional RNN, we would have to wait for the whole 10sec of audio to be recorded before we could tell if \"activate\" was said in the first second of the audio clip.  \n"
